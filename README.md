Personal website with minimal content-focused design and pop-out menus.
I have separate pages for portfolio and resume so I can point people to deticated
pages for those more important documents.

I spent a decent amount of time making sure all of the code was clean in this
project and so the code will document itself especially in the javascript.

REMEMBER TO `autocmd BufEnter *.html set ts=2 sw=2` TO RENDER TABS IN HTML
CORRECTLY
