Personal website with minimal content-focused design and pop-out menus.
I have separate pages for portfolio and resume so I can point people to deticated
pages for those more important documents.

I spent a decent amount of time making sure all of the code was clean in this
project and so the code will document itself especially in the javascript.

### Why are you using full tabs for indenting html?
More consistent with the rest of my code and when you are programming for hours
it makes a difference to have an 8 character wide indent. For html, which doesn't
do very well with full tabs, I like to use `autocmd BufEnter *.html set ts=2 sw=2`
to draw all tabs as two characters but only for html so I can have more content.
